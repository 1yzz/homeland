## Architecture Overview

**Homeland** is a Next.js service monitoring dashboard that discovers and tracks running services on a local machine. The application uses a server-side architecture with real-time service discovery capabilities.

### Core Components

**Service Discovery Engine** (`src/lib/serviceDiscovery.ts`):
- Scans common ports (3000, 3001, 8000, 8080, etc.) using `netstat`
- Detects service types by analyzing HTTP responses (frontend, API, web-server)
- Discovers Docker containers with exposed ports via `docker ps`
- Returns structured service data with port, type, status, and URL information

**Database Layer** (`src/lib/db.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`):
- Uses Prisma ORM with MySQL backend
- Service model supports service types (WEBSERVICE, BACKEND, SYSTEMD, DOCKER, etc.)
- Tracks service status (RUNNING, STOPPED, ERROR, STARTING, STOPPING)
- Stores service metadata including commands, working directories, and environment variables

**API Routes**:
- `GET /api/services` - Runs service discovery, updates database, returns all services
- `POST /api/services` - Creates new service entry
- `POST /api/services/scan` - Triggers service discovery scan only

**Frontend Components**:
- `ServiceCard` - Displays individual service with status indicators and "Visit Service" links
- `ScanButton` - Client-side component that triggers service discovery via API

### Service Discovery Flow

1. User clicks "Scan Services" â†’ triggers `/api/services/scan`
2. `scanRunningServices()` executes system commands to detect services
3. Services are upserted into database via `/api/services` endpoint
4. Main page displays services from database with real-time status

### Database Schema Notes

The `Service` model replaced the original `Website` model and includes:
- Service management fields (command, workingDir, envVars, autoStart)
- Enum types for consistent service categorization
- JSON field for flexible environment variable storage

### Key Dependencies

- **Prisma**: Database ORM and schema management
- **MySQL**: Primary database
- **Next.js 15**: App Router with server components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling with dark mode support
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
